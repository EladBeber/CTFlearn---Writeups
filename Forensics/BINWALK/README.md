## Solution

We have a huge hint to use Binwalk. Binwalk is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files and executable code.\
I recommend to read and investigate about file signatures and also on png and jpeg structre it will very help you in the next ctfs with the same concept.\
You cand look in there - [File Signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)\
