## Solution

So as mentioned in the title thie is **Substitution cipher** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher.  
For example ROT13 is a Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher. In ROT13, the alphabet is rotated 13 steps.

Lets use a online tool for the decryption - https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution
