## Solution
In the description we see an encryption with the name - **onetime pad** https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography_with_python/cryptography_with_python_one_time_pad_cipher.htm  
In this kind of encryption we use a key with the same size or longer of the plaintext that we want to encrypt.
So is kind of Vigen√®re Cipher but the different is that for any letter we have a special shift.  
For example we have a msg with 10 letters like "plain text" so we need to execute 26^10 possibilities to find the plaintext.  

The is vulnerability in this encrpytion if the plaintext is small or there is **reused of the key**.  
In our challenge we can see 11 lines of numbers. Maybe each line is a cipher text and each line encrypted with the same key.  

We will use the tool **crib drag** to check that. https://github.com/SpiderLabs/cribdrag  
We know that part of the key is **ALEXCTF{** is a good start.

We will get a lot of possibilities for plain text , We need to make a calculate guess of the each line.

After a little work we can get the full key that reused again and again.
