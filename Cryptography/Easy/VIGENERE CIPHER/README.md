## [Challenge](https://ctflearn.com/problems/305)

> The vignere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.<br /> Iâ€™m not sure what this means, but it was left lying around: blorpy gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}

## Solution
Ok , So we have the solution in the title as you can see "**VIGENERE CIPHER**" we need to decrypt the cipher with **VIGENERE**.\
As you can see in the site the flag start with "flag{" so we assume that **gwox** is encryption of **flag** so use this to find part of the key of the decryption , We will use this cyte - [VIGENERE CIPHER](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher).

As you cann see part of the decryption key is blor , Buy wait ... if you notice before the chiper we get the key:
but it was left lying around: **blorpy** gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}.So we also have the full key - **blorpy** , lets decrypt .

Flag : ```flag{CiphersAreAwesome}```
