## [Challenge](https://ctflearn.com/problems/305)

> The vignere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.<br /> Iâ€™m not sure what this means, but it was left lying around: blorpy gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}

## Solution
Ok , So we have the solution in the title as you can see "**VIGENERE CIPHER**" we need to decrypt the cipher with **VIGENERE**.\
As you can see in the site the flag start with "flag{" so we assume that **gwox** is encryption of **flag** so use this to find part of the key.\


Flag : ```0xc0ded```
