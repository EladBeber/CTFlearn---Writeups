> I love the smell of bacon in the morning!

## Solution
Read again the challenge... which word may be suspecious ???.\
Probably the word **bacon** becuase its not a simple word like "morning" , "love" , "smell" ,"the" ...
So maybe there is a encryption with the strange name **bacon** ?.\
Apparently there is - [Bacon's cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_cipher).\
Use bacon decode and get the flag - https://www.dcode.fr/bacon-cipher
